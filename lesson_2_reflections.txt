What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a new repository in the current directory and adds a .git file. You need to do this to enable git version control within the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows only the files that are ready to be committed to the repository. Therefore, it contains changes that are not included in the repository, but it may not include changes in all the files contained in the directory. It offers value in that it allows you to pick and choose which changes you want to commit to the repository.
