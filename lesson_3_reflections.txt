When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I might want to use a remote repository so that I can collaborate with others more easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have local changes or remote changes that you want to keep separately to avoid conflicts. Allowing automatic changes might push or pull changes that you are not ready to commit yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 A fork is a copy of another user's repository on github. A clone is a copy of a repository on github to local or a copy of a repository from local to local. A branch is a new path off of master in a repository.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 If you want to work on your computer and find a bug you can look back at the last state even if you did not make that commit.

 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 It would be much more difficult to collaborate without Git or GitHub, because it would be very easy for someone to save over each other's changes. In addition, it would be difficult to go make to previous versions. It would also be more difficult to share files. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have? Anytime you are collaborating with someone else or you are working on a new feature then you should create and work off a branch so you don't create problems in your master which you know works properly. The downside is that it can create merge conflicts which can get a bit confusing at times but this allows you to clearly see the merge conflicts and resolve accordingly without causing problems on master.
