When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I might want to use a remote repository so that I can collaborate with others more easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have local changes or remote changes that you want to keep separately to avoid conflicts. Allowing automatic changes might push or pull changes that you are not ready to commit yet.
